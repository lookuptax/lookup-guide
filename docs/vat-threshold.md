In many countries especially in EU if you make taxable supplies of goods or services below a certain annual limit , you might be exempt from tax. In such case you will not be required to register or collect taxes. Please note that these thresholds will change from country to country and some may not even have exemptions. Adding to these the rules or thresholds will be different for domestic and non-domestic sellers.

  <b> Things to Note</b>
  <p>
  - Australia. For taxi drivers, including chauffeur driven limousines, hire cars and sharing economy ride-share services, there is no registration threshold. The applicable registration threshold to not-for-profit organisations is AUD 150 000.
  </p>
  <p>
  - Belgium. The registration threshold for Belgium does not apply to several sectors: real estate; hotels and restaurants; sale of used and waste materials. A number of specific supplies are also excluded from the application of the threshold: several supplies of new real estate, supplies of certain products subject to excise duties and undeclared and illicit activities			
  </p>
<p>
- Canada. The registration threshold does not apply to certain selected listed financial institutions; non-residents who enter Canada to make taxable supplies of admissions to a place of amusement, a seminar, an activity or an event; and persons who carry on a taxi or limousine business (which include a commercial ride-sharing business). These persons are required to register for and collect GST/HST. An alternative threshold applies to charities and public institutions. A charity or public institution is not required to register if either its revenue from worldwide taxable supplies is CAD 50 000 or less in a calendar quarter and over the last four consecutive calendar quarters, or its gross revenue in either of its two preceding fiscal years is CAD 250 000 or less		
</p>
<p>
- Chile. All taxpayers are required to register and obtain a taxpayer’s identification number. However, small businesses, craftsmen and small service providers may be eligible for a special simplified regime according to which they account, for output VAT purposes, a monthly fixed amount based on an average level of earnings. This special regime has to be calculated by taking into account the earnings from the last 12 months and there is a threshold of 20 Monthly Tax Units (CLP 1 019 560 - USD 1 434). This simplified tax regime does not apply to legal entities but to individuals only. This system must be adopted for at least for 12 months after which the taxpayer can return back to the ordinary regime				
</p>
<p>
- Colombia. For an individual to be considered “non-responsible” its gross income of the current or immediately preceding fiscal year must be below 3.500 TVU and also comply with other requirements set forth in section 437 of the Colombian Tax Code. The VAT exemption threshold is mentioned in Tax Value Units ("Unidad de Valor Tributario" - TVU). The VAT exemption threshold is 3.500 TVU and the value of the TVU in Colombian Pesos (COP) is set every year by decree; the value for 1 TVU is COP 36.308 for fiscal year 2021. The VAT registration threshold for individuals is therefore 3.500 x 36.308 = 127.078.000 COP. There is no VAT registration thresholds for incorporated businesses.		
</p>
<p>
- Czech Republic. A taxable person that is not established in the Czech Republic should register immediately once he starts to provide any taxable supply within the territory of the country, except for supplies being subject to the reverse charge mechanism or to the mini one-stop shop (MOSS)		
</p>
<p>
- Denmark. A higher threshold of DKK 170 000 (EUR 22 840) applies to the blind, and a threshold of DKK 300 000 (EUR 40 300) applies to the first sale of works of art by their creator or his successors in title. For the purposes of the latter exemption, the threshold of DKK 300 000 must not have been exceeded in the current or preceding year		
</p>

<p>
- Finland. Where a business has exceeded the registration threshold of EUR 10 000, it must register and is subject to VAT, but a graduated relief is available until they reach a second threshold of EUR 30 000. On 1 January 2021, the registration threshold will be increased to EUR 15 000
</p>
<p>
- France. The VAT relief applies to businesses whose annual turnover does not exceed EUR 85 800 or when their turnover does has not exceeded EUR 94 300 the preceding calendar year (when the turnover has not exceeded EUR 85 800 the penultimate year). For supplies of services (except hotel accommodation and food and drink in restaurants), the annual turnover must not exceed EUR 34 400 or EUR 36 500 the preceding calendar year (when the turnover has not exceeded EUR 34 400 the penultimate year). For lawyers (in the furtherance of their regulated business), writers and artists, the turnover must not exceed EUR 44 500 (the threshold is EUR 18 300 for their supplies outside the normal framework of their affairs). Experimentally, for a period of five years, a specific threshold of EUR 100000 has been implemented in Guadeloupe, Martinique and La Réunion		
</p>

- Germany. Taxpayers are relieved from VAT obligations if their annual turnover does not exceed EUR 22 000 and their expected turnover for the current calendar year will not exceed EUR 50 000	
</p>
<p>
- Greece. If the annual turnover from taxable supplies is less than EUR 10 000, the business can voluntarily enter the Special Scheme for small businesses under which no VAT is collected. New businesses may also enter the Special Scheme upon registration. Farmers under the flat-rate scheme are not eligible to enter the Special Scheme for small businesses. Small businesses that have entered the Special Scheme will be obliged to enter the “normal” scheme and collect VAT from the moment they perform a taxable supply on account of which they exceed the threshold (and for the full value of that supply). In case the administrative period is less than a year, then the value of the taxable supplies for the purpose of determining whether the business may enter the Special Scheme during the next year is calculated on a proportional basis	
</p>
<p>
- Ireland. The general turnover threshold for the supply of goods is EUR 75 000. Persons supplying goods liable at the reduced or standard rates which they have manufactured or produced from zero-rated materials must however register if their turnover is EUR 37 500 or more. The general turnover threshold for the supply of services is EUR 37 500.

</p>
