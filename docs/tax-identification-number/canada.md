## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a Business Number (BN) if I am a freelancer?

Not necessarily. As a sole proprietor (freelancer), you only _need_ a Business Number if your total taxable revenues (before expenses) exceed **$30,000** in a single calendar quarter or over four consecutive calendar quarters. At that point, you must register for a GST/HST account, which generates a BN.<sup>[[1]](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/business-registration/business-number-program-account/need-bn.html)</sup> However, you can choose to register voluntarily before hitting this threshold to claim Input Tax Credits (refunds on GST/HST you pay for business expenses).

### What is the difference between a SIN, BN, and GST number?

- **Social Insurance Number (SIN):** A 9-digit personal identifier for working and filing personal income tax in Canada. You use this if you are a sole proprietor without a BN.
- **Business Number (BN):** A 9-digit number assigned to a business legal entity (corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship) to identify it to the government.
- **GST/HST Number:** This is your BN plus a program identifier. It is 15 characters long: the 9-digit BN + `RT` (for GST/HST) + `0001` (reference number).<sup>[[2]](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses.html)</sup>

### How can I verify if a GST/HST number is valid?

You can verify if a supplier's GST/HST number is valid using the official **GST/HST Registry** provided by the Canada Revenue Agency. You must enter both the GST/HST number and the supplier's name to confirm they match. This protects you from claiming ITCs on invalid invoices.<sup>[[3]](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/confirming-a-gst-hst-account-number.html)</sup>

### How do I find my Business Number if I lost it?

You can find your BN on your:

1.  **Income tax return** or **Notice of Assessment**.
2.  Incorporation documents.
3.  By searching for your business name on **Canada's Business Registries**.<sup>[[4]](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/cbr-rec/en)</sup>

### What formats are used for Canadian Tax IDs?

- **Business Number (BN):** 9 digits (e.g., `123456789`).
- **GST/HST Program Account:** 15 characters (e.g., `123456789 RT 0001`).
- **SIN:** 9 digits (e.g., `123 456 789`).
