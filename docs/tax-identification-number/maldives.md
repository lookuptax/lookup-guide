## Tax Identification Number (TIN)

In Maldives, Tax Identification Numbers (TINs) are crucial for individuals and entities mandated to register with MIRA (Maldives Inland Revenue Authority). Each taxpayer receives a distinct 7-digit identifier known as the business partner number. The TIN format follows `{BP}{Revenue Code}{Incrementing Number}`.

For instance, consider "Taxpayer A" with the business partner number 1000001. Upon registering for GST, they obtain the TIN `1000001GST501`. If the same taxpayer registers for Green Tax, the corresponding TIN becomes `1000001GRT001`, and so forth. The initial 7 digits remain unique, while the revenue code and sequence number are added, resulting in a TIN tailored to the specific taxes the taxpayer is registered under at MIRA. This systematic approach streamlines tax processes and ensures accurate identification.
