## Tax Identification Number (TIN) (NUIS)
The Tax Identification Number (TIN) for businesses is granted by the National Business Center (NBC), an Albanian government entity. Every business operating within the Republic of Albania must obtain the Number of Identification as a Taxable Person. The initial registration and any subsequent updates to the registration are processed through applications submitted to the National Business Center (NBC). Initial registration for non-profit organizations, tax representatives, and farmers is conducted at the Regional Tax Directorate of the relevant district.

**Format** 

The Tax Identification Number (TIN) assigned to taxpayers, including legal entities and individuals engaged in economic activities, follows the format J12345678N. The first character is a capital letter denoting the decade of TIN issuance (e.g., "J" for 1990-1999, "K" for 2000-2009). The second character indicates the year within the specified decade (e.g., 1 for 2011, 2 for 2012).

The third and fourth characters signify the converted month of TIN issuance, depending on the district where the business was originally established. For example, January in Tirana is represented by 13, February in Tirana by 14, January in another district by 25, February in that district by 26, and so on.

The fifth and sixth characters represent the day of the month on which the TIN was issued (e.g., 01, 02, 03, etc.). Characters 7 to 9 indicate the sequential order of TIN issuance on the specified day within a specific district (e.g., 009 is the 9th TIN issued in Tirana district, 108 is the 8th TIN issued in another district).

The tenth character is a check digit, a capital letter calculated based on a formula dependent on the first nine characters.

## National ID number (NID) 
The Tax Identification Number (TIN) for individuals, known as the National ID (NID), is issued to both Albanian citizens and **foreign citizens** with permanent residence in the Republic of Albania. It serves various purposes:

1. Inclusion in the National Registry of Civil Status.
2. As the identification number on the national identity document.
3. As a social security number for identification, registration, and claiming benefits from social security, health insurance, and other social protection programs.
4. Entry in the National Register of Elections.
5. As a Tax Identification Number.
6. For the issuance of a driving license.
7. To meet the requirements of other state institutions, including those related to justice, order, prosecution, education, and the Property Registration Office.
   
The individual Tax Identification Number (TIN), also known as the National ID number (NID), is a distinctive ten-character code (e.g., I05101999Q) containing encoded information, structured as follows:

- Characters 1 and 2: Year of birth
- Characters 3 and 4: Month of birth and gender
- Characters 5 and 6: Day of birth
- Characters 7 to 9: Issuing order number on the same date
- Character 10: Check digit.
